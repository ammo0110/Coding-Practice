## Roads and Libraries

* If c<sub>lib</sub> > c<sub>road</sub>, find strongly connected components. Each component corresponds to a library and each edge selection
corresponds to a road. Refer to [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/) link in case of help.
* If c<sub>lib</sub> <= c<sub>road</sub>, simply build a library in each city, in which case the cost would be equal to n * c<sub>lib</sub>
